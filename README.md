V-PAD:
This repository holds the source code and documentation for the Final Degree Project (TFG) focused on developing a 
**comprehensive Point of Sale (POS) System** specifically designed for the efficient management of restaurants, cafes, or fast-food chains.

The main objective is to build a robust, modular, and user-friendly application, covering both the user interface (Front-end) and the business logic and data persistence (Back-end) through a Full-Stack development methodology.

The project is being developed using a modern technology stack, adhering to a Full-Stack development architecture.

### 🌐 Front-end & Desktop App

| Technology | Role | Notes |
| **React (JavaScript/TypeScript)** | Main POS Interface. | Used to build a dynamic, reactive, and modular user interface. |
| **HTML5 & CSS3** | Structure and Styling. | Application foundation, focusing on a clear and intuitive User Experience (UX). |
| **Electron** | Desktop Target (Optional) | Evaluation for packaging the web application as a native desktop application (Windows, macOS). |

### 🧠 Back-end & Services

| Technology | Role | Notes |
| **SpringBoot Java** | RESTful API Services. | Initial use for business logic, data manipulation, and inventory/order management. |
| **C# (.NET)** | High-Performance Services (Optional) | Exploration for critical microservices or high-demand authentication services. |
| **Databases (SQL/NoSQL)** | Data Persistence. | (To be defined, will be specified here in the future: e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) |

GENERAL COMMENTS:
- In the Controller package, the @autowired notation is not neccesary, but it helps to understand the code better and what it does
